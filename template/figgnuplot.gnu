            # ******************** use python programmes ******************** #

# You can use python programmes from "outside" which allow you to do more things. 
# One example is the Bessel functions of any order. Gnuplot is limited to first order.
# 
# To defined a new function, simply create a programme.py and call it like this
# 
# bessel(n,x) = real(system(sprintf("python bessel1stkind.py %g %g", n, x)))
# 
# where
# 
# $ cat bessel1stkind.py 
# import sys
# import numpy as np
# from scipy.special import *
# 
# n=float(sys.argv[1])
# x=float(sys.argv[2])
# 
# print (jn(n,x))
# 
# Then simply use it in gnuplot
# 
# gnuplot> print bessel(1,1)
# 0.440050585744934
# gnuplot> print bessel(-2,1)
# 0.114903484931901

            # ******************** format tics ******************** #

# Some style about format:
# http://lowrank.net/gnuplot/tics-e.html

# gnuplot> set format x "%10.3f"
# 
# The syntax for the digit is "%" + (total length).(precision). The floating
# number 6.2 represents that the total length is six and there are two digits
# following the decimal point, so that tic-labels are shown as "5.00". It is
# possible to omit the length or precision, like 6 or .2. The default values are
# used for the omitted number.
# 
# The display format is expressed by one letter -- 'f', 'e', 'E', 'g', 'x', 'X',
# 'o', 't', 'l', 's', 'T', 'L', 'S', 'c', and 'P'. The default is "%g". When the
# tics-labels can be expressed by appropriate length and precision, those are
# written by "%.0f" format, otherwise "%e" format is used. The next table shows
# the difference among the format 'f', 'e', 'x', and 'o'. The formats 'e' and 'E'
# are the same except that the written text is 'e' or 'E'. The format "%O" exists
# in the gnuplot manual, but it does not work (bug ?) 
# 
# Format Explanation  Example (underscore means blank)
# f      decimal      %6.3f   __6.00
# e,E    exponential  %11.4e  _5.0000e+01
# x,X    hexadecimal  %x      fffffffb
# o,O    octal        %o      37777766 
# 
# The formats, 't', 'l', 'T', and 'L' are related to log-scale plot. 

            # ******************** samples ******************** #

# Gnuplot doesn't really draw curves for functions - it actually computes the
# functions at multiple points and connects them with straight lines, similarly
# to what would happen if you were plotting a data file
# 
# Sometimes when plotting analytical functions which span over many orders of
# magnitude, gnuplot does not have enough resolution, even if you set it to the
# maximum, which is about 8e6. For _one_ curve it should be enough but sometimes
# we are plotting various curves, so that the sampling is divided by the number
# of curves and hence, each curve has a lower sampling. This should be avoided
# because some extreme values might be missing.
# 
# The fix for this is the following
# 
# 1) output to a file with the data
# 
# set table "g.dat"
# 
# 2) Plot each of the curves. If you have the functions g(x), h(x) and i(x),
# 
# set samples 30*number of maxima (as a rule of thumb)
# set table "g.dat"
# plot g(x) 
# unset table
# 
# then
# 
# set table "h.dat"
# plot h(x)
# unset table
# 
# then
# 
# set table "i.dat"
# plot i(x)
# unset table
# 
# After that, in the gnu script you use
# 
# plot "g.dat" u 1:2 with lines ... ,\
#      "h.dat" u 1:2 with lines ... ,\
#      "i.dat" u 1:2 with lines ... ,\
# 
# And this way the functions g(x), h(x) and i(x) will have a higher resolution.
