It is very convenient to define a path where gnuplot knows where the
configuration files are. I also create directories in that location with
styles, definitions, macros, etc, so that I do not have to include them in
every single gnuplot script that I create. I have stolen the idea and some
scripts <a href="http://www.gnuplotting.org/">from this page</a>.

Configuration file and folders
==============================

As most UNIX programmes, gnuplot uses a configuration file which is usually
located in your home directory, `$HOME/.gnuplotrc`. However, I prefer to have
all configuration files stores in a folder which, in my case, is
`$HOME/fitx_confg` (from Catalan "fitxers de configuraci√≥", which means "blue
cucumbers" in English, obviously).

In my case, hence, the subfolder is

```~/fitx_confg/gnuplot```

where I have both the file gnuplotrc and another folder, called snippets. 

***(a) gnuplotrc***

First, let gnuplot know where `gnuplotrc` is. In my case, I have to run

```
$ ln -sf  /home/pau/fitx_confg/gnuplot/gnuplotrc  ~/.gnuplot
```

The contents of gnuplotrc are

```
# gnuplotrc configuration file
# Pau Amaro Seoane, Berlin, 24/Jul/2020

# Beause gnuplot does not allow to pass an argument
# to load this file, link its location to $HOME/.gnuplot
# In my case gnuplotrc is in $HOME/fitx_confg/gnuplot/ :

# ln -fs $HOME/fitx_confg/gnuplot/gnuplotrc $HOME/.gnuplot


            # ******************** loadpath ******************* #

set loadpath "/home/pau/fitx_confg/gnuplot/snippets/:/home/pau/fitx_confg/gnuplot/palettes/" # Do not use $HOME herei
```

If you wish, obviously, you can simply add that line to $HOME/.gnuplotrc and avoid the symbolic linking.

***(b) snippets***

The contents of snippets is the following:

```
$ ls snippets 
arrows.cfg       
convfactors.cfg  
header.cfg       
lines.cfg        
xborder.cfg      
yborder.cfg
constants.cfg    
grid.cfg
```

where, again, I have taken over a lot of things from <a href="http://www.gnuplotting.org/">gnuplotting</a>.

The most important file is `header.cfg`, which contains this

```
set terminal epslatex size 8.89cm,6.65cm color colortext 10 header "\\newcommand{\\ft}[0]{\\footnotesize}"
set border linewidth 4
set output "out.tex"
```

because I always use latex with gnuplot thanks to two scripts I wrote.

Using latex with gnuplot
=========================

I have two scripts (one of them is a silly one) to only use latex on the plots. These are included in the folder
`latex_scripts/`.  Make sure you have these two scripts on a folder which is on your path. 

The main script is the second one, which contains this information in the header

```
# This script is meant to quickly and silently produce an eps
# from a File.tex and File.eps created with gnuplot. 
#
#  Usage:  GpTex.sh [-p] filename
#
#  -p  optional, to convert to pdf and crop the file.  
#      This runs epstopdf and pdfcrop if -p is present.
#
#  filename  -- input file.  Presumed to be filename.tex
#
#
# You have to use the epslatex in gnuplot. This is an
# example:
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
# set terminal epslatex          <---                                     %
# set output "MyFile.tex"        <---                                     %
# set xlabel "Time ($10^9$ sec)"                                          %
# set ylabel "$e_{\\bullet}$"                                             %
# set mxtics 5                                                            %
# set mytics 5                                                            %
# set nokey                                                               %
#                                                                         %
# plot './orbital_elements.dat' u ($1/1e+9):2 ls 1 w l smooth csplines, \ %
#      'orbital_elements2.dat' u ($1/1e+9):2 ls 1 w l smooth csplines     %
#                                                                         %
# set terminal x11                                                        %
#%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
#
# All latex symbols need to be protected with a second backslash: \\
#
# Write the above script as MyScript.gnuplot and run
# $ gnuplot MyScript.gnuplot
# This produces a .tex file, which is the argument of GpTex.sh
# 
# Pau Amaro Seoane, 20/09/2011, Berlin 
#
#  Note:
#  I've used redirect to /dev/null to quiet LaTeX and dvips output
#  To restore the noise, simply remove those redirects.
```

The second script is just doing what is explained in the header

```
# This is a dummy script which uses
# gnuplot and GpTex -p assuming that
# gnuplot exports always to out.tex
# to then open it with a pdf viewer
```

This way, you just have to run from your terminal

```
$ Gnuplot.sh YourScript.gnu
```

This will create the figure with latex and open a viewer to have a look at the
outputted (and trimmed) pdf which, by default, is going to be called `out.pdf`.

Default template for gnuplot
=============================

I work with vi(m); in my `vimrc` file I have defined this line

```
"""" gnuplot
ab figgnuplot        ^[:r $HOME/fitx_confg/vim/motlles/figgnuplot.gnu^Mggdd
ab gnuplotfig        ^[:r $HOME/fitx_confg/vim/motlles/figgnuplot.gnu^Mggdd
```

so that when I type one of those two words in vim, a template appears with all
of the paths defined and also a skeleton for a general-purpose `.gnu` file. 

I have included the template `figgnuplot.gnu` in the `template` folder.
